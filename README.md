#Spotify Clone - Static Music Player

A simple and interactive music player inspired by Spotify. This project demonstrates a static implementation of a music application with features such as play, pause, progress tracking, and dynamic song information.

#Features

Dynamic Song List: Displays songs with their names, covers, and durations.
Play/Pause Functionality: Control playback for individual songs or from the main player.
Real-Time Progress Bar: Tracks the playback progress and allows seeking within the track.
Next/Previous Controls: Navigate through the playlist seamlessly.
GIF Animation: Adds a visual effect while a song is playing.

#Technologies Used
HTML5: Markup for the structure of the music player.
CSS3: Styling for a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript (ES6): Logic for dynamic behavior and interactivity.
How It Works

#Song Metadata Loading:
Each song's total duration is fetched dynamically when its metadata is loaded.
#Dynamic Time Updates:
The current playback time updates in real-time as the song progresses.
#Progress Bar Control:
Dragging the progress bar allows you to seek specific parts of the song.


#Project Structure

index.html: Contains the structure of the music player.
style.css: Defines the styling and layout.
script.js: Implements the player functionality.
Assets:
songs/: Directory for the audio files.
covers/: Directory for the song cover images.
